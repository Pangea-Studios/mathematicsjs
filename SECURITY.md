# Security Policies

## Hardware

Some of our functions are resource intensive. Most of these have an accuracy modifier in the options object, this may be changed for better performance with less accuracy. Other functions like the equation parser are resource intensive by design.

## Vulnerabilities and Memory Leaks

For memory leaks, create an issue and will fix it as soon as we can.

Vulnerabilities should be reported to one of the maintainers of the package, they will be listed below. Do not create an issue for vulnerabilities for security reasons.
